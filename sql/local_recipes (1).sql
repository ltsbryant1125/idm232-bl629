Cut off and discard\r\nthe bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small pieces,\r\nkeeping the florets intact. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and\r\nseason with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\r\n3. Prepare the remaining ingredients:\r\nWhile the broccoli roasts, peel the garlic. Roughly chop 1 clove. Finely chop the remaining clove; using the flat side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Using a peeler, remove the yellow rind of the lemon, avoiding the white pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter and deseed the lemon. Roughly chop the peppers. Finely chop the parsley leaves and stems. To make the gremolata, in a bowl, combine the lemon zest, chopped peppers, half the chopped parsley, the\r\njuice of 2 lemon wedges, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and as much of the garlic paste as you’d like. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n4. Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on\r\nboth sides. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of\r\nolive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fillets and cook 2 to 3\r\nminutes per side, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Leaving any\r\nbrowned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate.\r\n5. Make the pan sauce: Add the capers, chopped garlic, butter, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly and scraping up any fond, 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned and fragrant. Turn off the heat; stir in the juice of the remaining lemon wedges (be careful, as the liquid may splatter). Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n6. Finish the lentils & serve your dish:\r\nTo the saucepan of cooked lentils, add the roasted broccoli and gremolata. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the finished lentils with the cooked fish fillets. Top the fish with the pan sauce. Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley. Enjoy!\r\n'),
