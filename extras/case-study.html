                For my 2021 Fall Quarter scripting class, I was tasked with creating an online cookbook that will allow users to browse and search through a pre-written library of recipes. Over the course of 10 weeks, this site was built utilizing PHP as the primary scripting language with CSS for styling. The biggest challenge was the fact that this was my first time using PHP. My biggest challenge was getting the PHPmyAdmin database to update new data inputted by the user. In addition to that, I needed to implement a search function that would parse through all the recipes and display only specific ones based on the search. The goals for this website were to allow the user to create, edit, and delete their own recipes.
