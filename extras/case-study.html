            <p>Over the course of 10 weeks, I created an online recipe site utilizing PHP and CSS. The site allows users to view, add, edit, and delete recipes from a PHP database.</p>

                For my 2021 Fall Quarter scripting class, I was tasked with creating an online cookbook that will allow users to browse and search through a pre-written library of recipes. Over the course of 10 weeks, this site was built utilizing PHP as the primary scripting language with CSS for styling. The biggest challenge was the fact that this was my first time using PHP. My biggest challenge was getting the PHPmyAdmin database to update new data inputted by the user. In addition to that, I needed to implement a search function that would parse through all the recipes and display only specific ones based on the search. The goals for this website were to allow the user to create, edit, and delete their own recipes.

                The project first started with me designing the webpage using just HTML and CSS. I drew inspiration from various online recipe sites such as AllRecipes and NYTimesCooking. I chose red as my primary color as it draws on hunger for viewers, and used an offwhite for the background to offset the harshness of the color.

            <p class="b">
                After I completed the initial design of the site, I moved on to converting all the files to php and implementing its functionality. I started off by creating form elements that would allow users to input information into the site. Then, I linked it to my PHP database so that it would take this information and store it into a table. After that, I coded my website so that it would actually display this information once inputted. I also implemented the functionality of being able to edit and delta the information that the user inputs.

                For the final stage of this project, I had to implement the search functionality, as well as allowing the user to add images of their recipe. For the search function, I used PHP to parse the data in the PHP database for keywords within the recipes, displaying only the results that matched the keywords. To get the images working, I needed to have the site store the relative image path into the database table and then make my site display it along with the rest of the recipes information.

    <h2>The Solution</h2>

            <p>
                The color scheme I picked for this site was a simple red and white design. I wanted to keep the aesthetics simple in order to highlight the recipes better. A user is able to add in a new recipe, edit it, and delete it.

                For the most part, I think that this project was a success. I think the aesthetic design of the site turned out the way I wanted to. If I had more time, I would fix the functionality of the site. In the end, I was unable to get the pictures that the user uploads to display. However, the functionality of this feature worked on my local host.
